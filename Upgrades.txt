Perfect — that’s a rich set of activities! Let’s map them into game mechanics and potential upgrades in a way that makes the incremental progression feel engaging, educational, and consistent with your restoration theme. I’ll also note possible UI and prestige implications.

1. Core Activities

Activity	Mechanic	Resource / Cost	Notes / Upgrade Potential

Harvest Seeds	Collect seeds from matured plants	Requires bloomed plants	Can unlock efficiency upgrades (e.g., “Seed Collector Tools” for +50% yield)
Scatter Seeds	Plant seeds randomly in garden / plot	Seeds	Can unlock “Targeted Planting” to increase probability of high-value species
Grow Plugs	Convert seeds into nursery plugs	Seeds + time	Upgrades: faster growth, higher survival chance, increased plug output
Plant Plugs	Place nursery plugs into garden	Plugs	Can unlock “Precision Layout” to optimize bloom density for pollinators
Purchase Seed Mix	Spend seeds / biodiversity points for diverse plant mix	Seeds	Upgrade: “Rare Native Mix” for higher-value species, unlocks new pollinators
Prairie Burn	Reset mature plants for soil health / ecosystem bonus	Some plants temporarily lost	Upgrade: “Controlled Burn Technique” reduces plant loss and accelerates next growth
Pollinator Housing	Install bee boxes, bat boxes, etc.	Seeds / plugs / time	Boosts pollinator arrival and diversity. Upgrade: larger / more effective housing
Puddlers / Water Features	Add water sources for insects & amphibians	Seeds / plugs / space	Boosts pollinator activity in surrounding plants. Upgrade: expand water area or seasonal management

2. Upgrade / Prestige Ideas

Seed Efficiency – More seeds from bloom months.

Pollinator Attraction – More pollinators arrive faster or in greater numbers.

Plant Health – Reduced mortality, faster sprout/growth.

Diversity Multiplier – Points / impact scale with species variety, not just counts.

Regional / Global Expansion – Unlock new garden plots, parks, urban areas for restoration.

Knowledge / Research Points – Discover new species faster; unlock field guide blurbs and bonuses.

3. How They Fit in the Narrative

Start: Your backyard — scatter seeds, plant plugs, grow basic flowers.

Neighborhood: Purchase seed mixes, install pollinator housing, create mini-prairie patches.

Community: Conduct prairie burns, expand garden plots, provide puddlers for insects.

Regional / Global: Large-scale seed mixes, coordinate with local groups, unlock rare pollinators.

4. UI & Game Flow Suggestions

Action Buttons: Harvest, Scatter, Plant Plug, etc. with cooldown / animation for clarity.

Inventory Panel: Show seeds, plugs, and available upgrades.

Prestige / Tier Feedback: Each tier unlocks new activities and upgrades visually.

Field Guide & Journal: Show plant/pollinator relationships, include tips for each activity.

Monthly Progression: Activities are more effective during bloom/seed months.

If you want, I can sketch a full “activity tree” with upgrade paths showing which activities unlock which upgrades and how they affect biodiversity and species counts. This helps structure the incremental progression clearly.

Do you want me to do that next?
